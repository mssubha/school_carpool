# SchoolPool ðŸŒ± 
![](file:///Users/victorsi/Desktop/Screen%20Shot%202020-03-14%20at%2012.44.09%20AM.png)
SchoolPool is a web application focused on driving children safely to school while being environmentally friendly. Parents can search a carpool buddy for their kids based on distance from their home, childâ€™s grade, pet and smoking preferences. After finding the best carpooler, a request can be sent via the web application and a SMS will be sent to the carpooler that a request has been sent. The carpooler can view the request in the application and decide on accepting or denying it. Once a decision has been made, the carpooler who sent the request will also be notified by a SMS. Google Maps JavaScript API was used for geocoding and maps display. Twilio's programmable messaging API was used for sending text messages.<br>
